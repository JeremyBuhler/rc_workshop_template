# OER pre-publish checklist

[Workflow considerations when working with CC licensed works.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1v8vi7HGRp9mxUWO4MAVn7vqV809yIoR-uLnhPjPl6ao/edit?usp=sharing)

[How to correctly search for copyright permissions and attribute borrowed works.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1M-m_LZ8TJzDsDFDf0aB92iv1BtxqiKb9XUppSQHItFM/edit?usp=sharing)

## Can your material be published openly?
- [ ] Is the work you borrow protected by copyright?   

- [ ] If NO, then you can use without further consideration (typically this only applies if the work is very old or has been bequeathed to the public domain)  

- [ ] If YES, you need to identify if you have permission to reuse or not. This permission can come in the form of

1. A direct response to a permission request to the creator/copyright holder  

2. A general statement made by a creator (think website terms of use that allow for educational use)  

3. The inclusion of an open license such as creative commons, GNU, MIT etc. If the work is licensed under an open license there will be licensing requirements. The most common of which is attribution. If you use a work that is openly licensed and requires attribution, you are obliged to comply. To do otherwise may be an infringement.  

## Is your work openly licensed?
Make your work openly available by assigning your own open license to it.

- [ ] Apply a CC-BY or CC-0 license to the content making up the resource.

- [ ] Make sure the license is in a highly visible place and you let potential users know which parts of the work are original to you (and under the terms of the open license).

**This includes:**

- [ ] Reveal.js slide deck in .pdf

- [ ] Images or other files created for use in the OER

- [ ] Indicate which parts have been borrowed from other sources (and will have their own reuse terms). Attribution should include: Title, Author, Source, License

- [ ] Apply an MIT license to the workshop template by adding a line to the README.md file (This can also be done with a license.txt file if that is more appropriate for the repository content)
